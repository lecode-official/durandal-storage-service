# Durandal Storage Service

A simple storage library written in TypeScript that can be used to access local storage, session storage, and non-persistant storage in a simple manner. This storage service is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
